  <h2>Internships</h2>

  <h3> Machine Learning Intern at the CTO Office, Ansys, Summer 2020 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Worked on the deep learning solution for 3D topology optimization as a machine learning Ph.D. intern.</li>
    <li>Proposed a algorithm to generate attention masks for a deep learning framework design for end-to-end learning of the 3D topology optimization. The modified model achieved 20% improvement in terms of prediction error.</li> 
    <li>Designed and tested a series of loss functions targeting at enhancing the model in thin member size and symmetric constraints.</li> 
  </ul>
